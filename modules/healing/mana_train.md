# Mana Train

![](../../_media/modules/healing/mana_train.png)


Cast a spell when your mana is above a percentage, usually used for [Magic Level](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Level) training.

- **Options:**
  - `Spell Hotkey:` Hotkey of the spell to waste your mana.
  - `Min above %:` Percentage of mana to **start** casting the spell.
  - `Don't use with chat on:` Useful to not cast the spell when you are typing(with *"Chat on"* in Tibia).

?> To avoid misconfiguration, the `Min above %` option can not be set **lower** than Mana Healing's `Min mana %`, it also can't be lower than **20%**.
